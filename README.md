A small project to put in practice some concepts about JWT auth and safety issues.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo and run:

This repo links to the submodules of server and client. Inside each one, run the above command as well. Then, on the root directory, run:

```
npm run dev
```

### Prerequisites

## Running the tests

Currently with no tests (sorry...)


## Deployment to Heroku's test machine

From within each repo (server and client) you can deploy to Heroku.

```
git push <heroku_repo_name> master
```
